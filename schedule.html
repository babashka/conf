In this talk I'll explain some of the notable features and benefits of this system, for example, how state updates are made by submitting database transactions (to XTDB) written as SCI code. I'll explain why I chose SCI and some of the reasons SCI makes a perfect scripting language to embed in a JVM-based application, providing some tips along the way to others who want to try using SCI in this way.</p><p class="bio">Malcolm is a Clojure developer with a keen interest in software architecture and API security.

One way to seek such balance is the "namespace as a notebook" approach: enjoying the playfulness of the Clojure editor and REPL in a self-documenting fashion, generating a document as a side-effect. This has been manifested in different ways through the evolution of tools such as Oz, Notespace, Clerk, and Clay. 

Of all the above, Clay intentionally tries to be the least clever, offering a minimalistic approach targeting documents such as HTML files, Quarto pages, and reveal.js presentations. These documents can include interactive widgets and access various data visualization libraries using SCI (through Scittle).

In this talk, we will explore a real-world data-science problem using Clay, focusing on usability and the desired workflow.
Our perspective will be the Scicloj journey to make Clojure a friendly option for people tackling data and science problems. We will discuss the role of SCI in the solution, as well as some of the technical and conceptual challenges on that path.

Basic knowledge of Clojure will be assumed.</p><p class="bio">Daniel Slutsky is a mathematician and a data scientist who has been using Clojure since 2013.
In his professional path, Daniel has primarily worked in data science and backend teams at startups, addressing diverse topics such as time-series analysis, recommendation systems, geospatial analysis, and NLP.
His MSc thesis was in pure math around topics of probability theory.
Daniel is a community organizer at the Scicloj community, building a Clojure stack for data science and running various Clojure study groups and dev groups. His approach towards community building and teaching is drawn from his experience as a community organizer in various local activist groups and his yoga instructor training.
He has been co-maintaining several Clojure open-source projects, particularly Clojisr, Notespace, Kindly, and Clay.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="border border-slate-300 h-14 pl-2 align-top w-1/3">11:50</td><td class="border border-slate-300 pl-2">ü•óü•óLunch (we'll go out, bring cash)ü•óü•ó</td></tr><tr><td class="border border-slate-300 h-14 pl-2 align-top w-1/3">13:30</td><td class="border border-slate-300 pl-2">‚ö°‚ö°Ô∏èLightning talks‚ö°‚ö°<br /><span class="text-base">sign up on the day - 5 min each</span><br /><span class="font-medium text-sm">30 min</span></td></tr><tr><td class="border border-slate-300 h-14 pl-2 align-top w-1/3">14:10</td><td class="border border-slate-300 pl-2">Do or Do Not Clojure<br /><span class="text-base">Gert Goet</span><br /><span class="font-medium text-sm">30 min</span><p class="abstract">When was the last time you ran into a new library and thought: ‚ÄúIf only I could give it a spin real quick‚Ä¶‚Äù?
